# writeups

These are writeups for CTF boot2root machines I created, both of which are hosted on https://tryhackme.com but only `obscure` is publicy available and `revworks` was made for a local prize giveaway I hosted:
- [obscure](https://tryhackme.com/room/obscured)
- [revworks](https://tryhackme.com/jr/revworks)

There are also writeups for [ropemporium](https://ropemporium.com/) challenges.
